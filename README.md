# Trump Talk

A funny app that was made to entertain, shortly after the election of Donald Trump. I published this app to the appstore as well.

**Note**
Trump Talk was also a very painful app to create. It had around 150 different animations and tweets of Donald Trump which we're hillarious, but I realized most of my time was spent searching for content than actually coding the app. However, where I did not learn about programming I learned more about graphic design and appealing graphical interfaces. The app became very beautiful, I made the animations myself with Photoshop and worked hard on making the app seamless.
